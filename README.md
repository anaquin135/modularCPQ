# modularCPQ
A project to build a CPQ solution with Python and Flask that is modular in nature.
Each core component of the application is to be split into a separate service.

Currently, there is a service for:
1. Authentication
2. Opportunity Details
3. Product Definitions
4. Quote Templates and Terms
5. A client which interfaces with each.

WIP / Todo:
1. Enhance configuration module to support attribute-based Part Number resolution.
